## Assignment 1
**Codes for detecting and correcting transmission errors:**
- Task 1 - develop codes correcting a single bit error for eight-bit messages (1 byte) and another correcting a double bit error for eight-bit messages (1 byte).
- Task 2 - A program that encodes any file into an encoded form and decodes it back to its original form, correcting any errors that may have occurred.

## Assignment 2
**Implementation of the XModem file transfer protocol:**
- Implementation of a protocol compliant with the XModem specification. Testing it with other programs that also have this protocol using serial port emulation.

## Assignment 3
**Static Huffman Coding Algorithm:**
- Task 1 - developing a code dictionary for a sample message.
- Task 2 - building programs that encode a text file and send it using the socket method to another computer, on which a second program is implemented, whose task is to receive, decode and save it to disk.

## Assignment 4
**Analog-to-digital conversion A/C and D/A:**
- Building an A/C and D/A converter module that converts sound from analog to digital and vice versa.
- Saving the recorded sound as a waw file containing sampled and quantized sound.
- Checking the quality for the largest possible number of quantization levels and sampling frequencies.
- Calculating the SNR coefficient value for each obtained result relative to the signal with the best parameters.
